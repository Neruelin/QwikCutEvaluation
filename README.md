# QwikcutEvaluation

Part of a coding evaluation process for a QwikCut interview.

## Objectives:

1. Include a video player on the page and allow the user to play any of the clips whenever they want.
2. A play/pause button and a seek bar need to be included in the video player.
3. The information for each clip needs to be displayed at all times so that the user can easily find the clips they want to watch.
4. There needs to be some kind of indication showing which clip is currently playing.
5. When a clip ends, the next one plays. When the last clip ends, the video pauses and nothing else plays.

## My extra customizations:

1. Restyling of the website to colors observed from the Company Logo.
2. Page built from a composition of abstracted components rather than a single massive component. Also showcases passing event handlers and data between components.
3. Addition of a sound on/off toggle.
4. Addition of a side-scrollable clip library container.
5. Addition of conditional style on the clip library items indicating the currently active clip.
6. Addition of on hover styles to increase usability of clip controls.
